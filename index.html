                <p>After concentrating in data analytics during my MBA at University of Denver, I applied that skillset in my work as both a strategic analyst for Cactus Ad Agency and then as an associate for Stonehill Asset Management. 

                Core to my problem-solving practices in all of my roles however, has been a methodology based on design thinking principles—focusing on the needs of users and endeavoring to solve their pain points. With that now having led me to UX/UI design, I have been able to combine my analytical chops with tools like Adobe XD, Sketch, and Figma, to help me bring digital solutions to user’s pain points to fruition.</p>
